# What is the SOSIEL Algorithm?

The SOSIEL (Self-Organizing Social & Inductive Evolutionary Learning) Algorithm implements boundedly-rational decision-making by one or more agents. Each SOSIEL agent makes decisions using a cognitive architecture that consists of nine cognitive processes that enable each agent to interact with other agents, learn from its own experience and that of others, and make decisions about taking, and then take, (potentially collective) actions. The SOSIEL Algorithm takes the form of a .dll file. 

# Features

- [x] Each agent can engage in anticipatory learning, goal prioritizing, counterfactual thinking, innovating, social learning, goal selecting, satisficing, signaling, and (potentially collective) action-taking.
- [x] Four alternative cognitive levels, with each level composed of a different combination of cognitive processes and representing an alternative approach to modeling agent behavior.
