# SOSIEL
SOSIEL (Self-Organizing Social &amp; Inductive Evolutionary Learning) is an open-source multi-agent algorithm that simulates spatiotemporal complexity of social contexts in which the heterogeneity of knowledge, the need for learning, and the potential for collective action play a significant role. The SOSIEL Platform can simulate the cross-generational progression of one or a large number of boundedly-rational agents, each of which is represented by a cognitive architecture that consists of theoretically-grounded cognitive processes and agent-specific and empirically-grounded knowledge. The agents can interact among themselves and/or with coupled natural (e.g., LANDIS-II) and/or technical systems, learn from their and each otherâ€™s experience, create new practices, and make decisions about taking and then take (potentially collective) actions.
